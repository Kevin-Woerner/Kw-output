Output of FWIP-Support acting on Kw-Code
These files contain dozens of mathematical functions I've found useful over the years.
I got tired of writing a useful function in one language,
   discovering it would be useful in another language,
   porting it over,
   discovering some bug / glitch in said function
   fixing it in one place and not the other,
   and then wondering why it wasn't working the code I didn't fix.
And so I wrote a 'meta-language', FWIP with a very simplistic syntax,
   that I could write my useful functions in,
   and then have the computer spew out code for various languages
   (currently Supported languages: Python, Perl, GNU BC, Visual Basic 6, and VB.Net)
